The truth is that I'm a jack of many trades but the one thing in common with everything I do is people. I have been working with people, for people, all my life. It started with selling freshly caught trout to elderly people in my neighbourhood during high school, as they rarely got the chance to get their hands on some.</p><p>In my mid-twenties, I counted all the things I had done at that time and realised that I had experienced over 20 professions varying from the odd construction gigs to bakery assistant to restaurant chef - I even cleaned public transport vehicles during nights in Helsinki while studying arts. That pretty much defines me both professionally and personally - I have never shied away from new things, responsibility or tasks of any kind, as long as I sensed that there is a possibility to learn something on the way. Good or bad, I find ways to enhance my understanding of myself, my surroundings and of people. Later on in life, I learned to channel this and found myself in a leadership role in a company that works for people and with people in distress, and here I found something that felt right. A role that was ever-changing and evolving, a role where you get challenged every day and foremost get to learn stuff and at the same time get to support and help your colleagues in their respective quests. I have been on this track for a decade now and not regretted a second of it, and now I can finally make sense of it to my kid: \"well son, Daddy is a ninja\" and my son replies \"wauu that's so cool Daddy, I want to be a ninja too, like kung-fu panda\". If my story does not point out what gives me most satisfaction in my job, here it comes: Learning, growing and having fun while doing it. </p><p>I'm a naturally curious person and I'm interested in learning more about the business that we operate in, all aspects of it and as much as possible for for someone who never really got around to delving into the deeper aspects of technology, but always enjoyed the benefits that it has brought us. When not dabbling in human understanding or enhancing my knowledge base professionally, you might find me at some obscure river or lake somewhere gathering my thoughts and trying to become a l33t fisherman. I am also very found of reading - especially historical fiction or fantasy in my spare time.</p>  ",

When not travelling the world myself, I worked at a travel agency helping others get out travelling. As a side income, I took photos and created videos.

I, like many others my age, owned a Commodore 64 and my family was one of the first to have a PC amongst my friends growing up. Although – out of curiosity - I had picked computers apart, or gone on a mission to down the operating systems in the more stubborn of them, I never thought of doing anything real with that curiosity.</p> <p>Years later, after having worked mainly in the home care sector, I finally decided to go back to school. I felt that I needed to find something to sink my teeth into intellectually that would also allow me to be creative. So, one day I sat myself down with an educational catalogue, and decided to try out a web-development program that looked interesting. That decision turned out to be a real turning point, as programming is perfect for someone like me. It provides me with both a mental challenge as well as a blank canvas that allows vast possibilities for creative expression. I prefer to work the full-stack with either C# or JAVA, as well as working with JavaScript in various forms. I find UX-design to be really fun and interesting – it’s a universe of it’s own. One of the things that I love about working as a full-stack developer, is that it brings a sort of autonomy to me as a developer.

They were about HTML, and even one post was about the then just invented language Javascript. I was about 12 or 13 and the Internet had started to gain mainstream momentum. The dot-com bubble was building up. It would burst in March 2000, and I would give up on programming long before that, I just didn't know that while writing those posts.</p><p>It felt like I had to wait a million years to get computer access at home. To stand the waiting, I started collecting computer magazines, bringing the attached floppies and later CD-ROM's over to friends with computers to see what they contained. These magazines also used to provide simple guides on various topics, one of those happened to be HTML. I had to memorize the tags so that I could test them out by entering them in notepad.exe on the demo systems at my local Lap Power dealership.</p><p>I was 11 when I got my hands on a screaming fast multi media monster (Pentium MMX) at home, a year later, a Telia 020 dialup connection completed the setup. It gave me everything I ever wished for. At this point, I knew very well how to abuse the <marquee> HTML tag and quickly managed to set up Geocities hosting.</marquee></p><p>The Internet was very different back then. It provided me with a safe space during my years in secondary school. I even OP'd a successful channel on DALnet during those years. I never really got the hang of how the Perl scripts on Matt's Script Archive worked or what Dim meant in Visual Basic. I wanted to, but my interest had already started to shift to movie making.</p><p>In my later teens, I tried my best preparing for a career in film making. It proved to be difficult, being based in a small town far away from the industry didn't exactly help. To me, it made little sense to move just to Stockholm. If relocation was going to be required, why not move even further away. That's how I ended up in the Netherlands and how I began my exploration of north-west Europe. Brussels, Belgium was to follow, and before finally ending up in Stockholm, I spent ten years in Hamburg, Germany.</p><p>I think it was in the Netherlands that I got my first VPS, I was a bit afraid at first, as it didn't come with a full-blown desktop environment that I had come to expect from my time using Red Hat Linux 5.2 (not REHL, much older). I slowly started to figure out how the command line worked, and with time people would actually pay me to do system administration for them. One thing bothered me, though, while I was confident in configure and run applications, I could still not fully understand how something was working by reading its source code.</p><p>After doing Sysadmin, I developed a passion for programming. I remember, for years, all I did was study programming. I lived and breathed programming. I didn't even follow the news during these years, it's as if they didn't exist.</p><p>I now work as a Devops, making good use of the experiences that led me to this position.</p>  ",

I love finding patterns and simple logic solutions to see complex problems unmask. I also have a great interest for agile processes with short release cycles and rapid feedback loops. In projects I gladly take the tech lead role, and I believe in mixed teams where developers, business and testers work closely together. My experience stretches from bank sector to e-commerce business, with a deep knowledge in the Microsoft technology stack and the .Net ecosystem.</p><p>It is important for me to be up to date on new techniques and development methodologies. Therefore, I continuously consume books, conference video recordings, podcasts, and actively monitor social media blog and twitter posts.</p><p>Even if I enjoy spending time combining job and hobby, a good work life balance is important. My spare time is spent with my beloved wife and kids, preferably outdoors, hiking and taking photos.</p>​  ",

That choice has lead me to visit many different places and meet many interesting people all over the world; from Geneva to Cape Town, passing through Barcelona and of course Malmö along the way. During my almost 14 years of experience in the field, I’ve seen how trends in web development come and go. </p><p>I started my professional career at the United Nations with a case study of workflows within Content Management Systems, and I was quickly drawn to the .NET environments and how the architectural concepts went through all layers of a CMS. As the web evolved so did I; Visual Studio, C# andMSSQL all quickly became standard tools in my developer toolbox. Later I also acquired an EpIServer CMS certificate and moved forward with more complex architectures.</p><p>In 2008 I moved to Cape Town, South Africa and decided to try and make a change in people's day-to-day lives by offering my services for free to local grassroots organizations. After doing this for almost 2 years, I started work with an EpiServer partner and dug further into the .NET world including REST APIs and Web Services. I did stay a bit longer than intended in South Africa as I met my wife there and we now share 2 beautiful kids that take up most of my free time. </p><p>In 2015 I jumped on the cloud wagon and started developing cloud applications in both Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure. I still do small applications, but usually deal with bigger architectural solutions. </p><p>If there is one thing my journey has taught me, it is that the only constant in this field - as in life - is change, and therein lies the need to keep on moving forward.

I remember thinking that the possibility to solve complex problems by just writing some code is really cool. I took many courses where I could combine my knowledge in programming, mathematics and physics which was both challenging and fun. I did my master in computational mechanics and the thing I enjoyed the most was to write the simulation programs and to see it come alive on the screen.</p><p>2017 I started my journey as a consultant in programming and the only thing I knew was that I wanted to code. With an open mind and being able to work with talented people I learned so much. I have had the opportunities to work with everything from Javascript and React in frontend to Golang, Node and AWS in backend. Everything has been fun and challenging in its own way.</p><p>I am a very curious person and love to learn new things, if I do not know it I usually try to learn it by reading or listening to others if it can help me solve a problem. Recently I decided to improve in advanced design patterns and learning MySQL. I believe that with an open mind and a mind set to learn and share we can do great things together.</p><p>When I do not work I like to play games of all kinds, from board games to computer games with friends. My sambo loves to travel and we are both interesting in food which is great because she always have a good idea of where to go and eat on the weekends. I bought a road bike 2020 and I really enjoy the freedom to bike around in Skåne, see the nature and to go fast with good company.</p>  ",

Just like most music creators, they love working with people and share their ideas, which gives me another reason to enjoy my work. My true pleasure and motivation stems from the idea of people being able to enjoy something I helped create. That part alone lets me know that I am exactly where I should be.When I am not designing I enjoy working out, spending time with family and playing video games. Another hobby of mine is to taste different things, both literally and figuratively in order to see what else I enjoy in life. This is also something that feeds my creative cravings, though it helps me with ideas for work that I put out.  ",

At high school I had my first interactions with basic html &amp; css web design and C# programming.</p><p>Shortly after high school, I landed a job as an audio/video technician &amp; project manager for conferences and live events. This allowed me to delve deeper into the art of solving tech-related problems for clients for a living - oh the joy! This meant putting together my optimal mix of tech and people to help clients achieve their goals in the best possible way. I spent five years in this profession before feeling the urge to branch out and take a new career path. Two years later, and with a diploma in complex IT sales, I find myself a part of the magnificent tretton37 family of driven problem solvers and skilled software developing craftsmen.</p><p>While I might not have pursued my early impressions of web and software development, I’ve focused instead on finding synergies between people, business and technology. Today, tretton37 presents me with the opportunity to continue on my tech-related problem solving path. This involves matching clients’ complex problems with the best team possible for creating well thought out, handcrafted solutions - always with world class user experiences and a proven business value top of mind.</p><p>My spare time these days still involves playing and writing music, by myself or with my band. I also enjoy travelling with my girlfriend or going out for a nice dinner with friends. Oh - and did I mention that I still love playing computer and video games? :)</p> ",

Pretty quickly I got involved in the so-called demo scene (a sub culture for showing off your artistic and programming skills) and started to create so-called computer demos with my team, competing against others teams at demo parties. Our team consisted of people from all over Sweden, and even other countries. In retrospect I realise that, as young teenagers we were working on projects together in self-organising distributed teams. We were using the ways of remote communication available at the time, which was the telephone, letters with floppies and sometimes modems. All of this gave me some really valuable lessons that proved to be essential throughout my work life. What happened to the demo scene and the team? Well, we are still doing things together, on Commodore 64, Amiga and other retro platforms, going to demo parties and competing with other teams.</p><p>Working with software engineering gives me a perfect mix of creativity and structure.

It gives me a great feeling when I see people helping each other out and learning together. To coach people to learn, explore and push their abilities further is something I want to dive deeper into in the future.</p><p>Outside of the office, I enjoy spending as much time as I can with my wife and daughter, meeting friends, and occasionally enjoying a good run.
